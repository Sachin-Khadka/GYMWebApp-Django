# GYM Application (Using Django framework)

This webapp is all about GYM. This web application is build using Python programming language in the Django framework. 
The aim of this website was to gain hands-on experience on web development as applicable in software companies and/or industries.  It is about creating courses for people who are too busy at work or at home where they miss their exercises. This gym webapp provides different exercise courses made by professional trainers. This gym web application has multiple features where people can upload their workout videos/images or download exercise videos to exercise 
when they have time in their busy schedule

Ultimately, this web application is about keeping your physical and mental health healthy 
even when you are not able to go to gym regularly, by taking training courses created by 
professional trainers. It has the option of choosing premium membership and normal 
membership where premium members can track their workout, upload photos and videos to 
keep them motivated. This web application is not made just for customers but also for trainers 
who want to train others with simple exercises that can be done both in work and at home 
whenever they are able to. Most gyms might not be available 24/7 but our gym is available 
24 hours a day and seven day a week. There will be different web pages with motivational 
things like motivational videos or achievements achieved by users who have been taking 
courses at our gym. Sometimes, no matter how important your goals are to you, it's a struggle 
to bring your best effort to your gym session. But whether you're trying to lose weight, train 
for a race, keep your stress in check, or any of the other worthwhile reasons to make fitness 
a part of your life, staying consistent is key, even when you really, really, really don't feel 
like it. When you're struggling to remember why it's worth all the effort, our gym will give 
you the push you need.
